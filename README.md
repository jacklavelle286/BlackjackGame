# BlackjackGame

Blackjack Game
This is a simple implementation of the popular card game blackjack, where the objective is to get a score of 21 or as close as possible without going over. The game is played against the computer, and the user can choose to "hit" and draw another card or "stand" with their current hand.

How to Play
Run the script in your command line or terminal with the command python blackjack.py.
You will be prompted to start a new game. Type y to begin, or n to exit the game.
You will be dealt 2 cards, as well as the computer. Your cards will be displayed, along with your current score. The computer will only show one of their cards.
You will be prompted to "hit" or "stand". Type y to draw another card, or n to stand.
If you go over 21, you lose automatically. If you choose to stand, the computer will continue drawing cards until they have at least 17 points.
Once the game is over, the final scores will be compared, and the winner will be announced.
You will be prompted to play another game.
Requirements
Python 3.x
random library
input library
Note
The game is a simple text-based version and can be run in the command line or terminal. It could be used as a base for further development into a more complex web application.

Deployment
The game is currently deployed as a script that can be run locally. However, it could be deployed as a web application using a framework like Django, which would allow for a more interactive and visually appealing experience.
